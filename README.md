New Project Overview Documentation
==================================

This document outlines a simple process for presenting a future project in a way that allows for project awareness, yet does not put hard deadlines into action. This process is designed for a retainer developer or an in-house developer.

### Goal
The goal is to pass tentative details concerning a new project that is either in the pipeline or ready for construction. 

### Purpose
The purpose of is to allow the developer adequate time for possible preparations.

An example would be: The developer is updating an application with new functionality. With proper notice the new functionality could possibly be completed in time for the project. The most stable release is always available, however new functionality may expedite a project and boost development time.

### What we are trying to avoid
1. Avoid the random chance that a project arrives and the code that is needed to build it is in a transitional phase because of lack of communication.
2. Avoid lack of knowledge around a particular code base due to lack of time around project constraints.

### Tentative schedules
In early stages project schedules are too fluid to be given a hard timeline. It is not expected that preliminary timelines will hold true. 

### What information to send
- Scope of the project. 
- Preferred code base to use.
- Tentative month or week the project is hopeful to start.
- Tentative month or week the project is expected to be handed to the developer.
