New Project Overview Documentation
==================================

This document outlines a simple process for presenting a future project in a way that allows for project awareness, yet does not put hard deadlines into action. This process is designed for a retainer developer or an in-house developer.

### Goal
The goal is to pass along details concerning a new project so the developer is aware. Awareness of an upcoming project can be a huge asset when dealing with surrounding communities and information flow. _The developer may hear of a technology that could help with a project, but he may not have none it would be helpful because he didn't know about the project._

### Purpose
The purpose of is to allow the developer adequate time for possible preparations.

**Example:** The developer is updating an application with new functionality. With proper notice the new functionality could possibly be completed in time for the project. The most stable release is always available, however new functionality may expedite a project and boost development time.

### What we are trying to avoid
1. Avoid the random chance that a project arrives and the code required to build the project is in a transitional phase that is beneficial to the project.
2. Avoid lack of knowledge around a particular code base due to project time constraints.

### Tentative schedules
In early stages project schedules are too fluid to be given a hard timeline. Preliminary timelines are assumed to be tentative or hopeful at best.

### Tentative information to send
- Scope of the project
- Preferred code stack: e.g. WordPress, Strait PHP and HTML, Other.
- Tentative month or week the project is hopeful to start.
- Tentative month or week the project is expected to be handed to the developer.

### Needed Project Specs
- Domain name
- Server location
- Email needs if any
